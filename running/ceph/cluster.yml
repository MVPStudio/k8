# Our cluster setup. This was copied from
# https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.2/ceph-cluster-crd.html and then modified (by
# specifying the correct devices to use, enabling the dashboard, etc.) rather
# than starting with the example in their github examples as that was 99%
# irrelevant stuff that was commented out.
